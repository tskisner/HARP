This directory demonstrates compilation of external HARP plugins.

First, install HARP and ensure that the "harpconfig" script is in your
default PATH (type "which harpconfig" to verify).  Now you should be able
to type "make" in this directory and it will compile a single *.so file
(which is the plugin) and the executable "harp_example", which simply
tests the instantiation of the fake example plugins.

To test that the example plugins are loaded, export the directory containing
the *.so file to HARP_PLUGIN_PATH.  If you are in this directory currently
you can do:

$>  export HARP_PLUGIN_PATH=`pwd`

and then run the test executable:

$>  ./harp_example

This enables extra debugging information in the registry in order to show
what DLLs are being loaded.

To actually use your own plugins with tools like harp_extract, ensure that
the JSON parameter file that is passed to that tool contains the name of
your plugin type and any parameters it needs.
